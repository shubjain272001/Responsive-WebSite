            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Interior design not just stands with a look and beauty, added to beauty it also has ability to showcase even a studio apartment as residence which has enough space with the help of proper design and comforting lighting. Whereas, a poor interior design makes a larger house that lack space. Interior designers are experts in creating more spaces, improving the space efficiency, improving the functional usage of space, improving the lighting effect, improving the color effects, improving the textures, patterns, scale, size etc. They are also experts in selecting fittings & equipment. To be precise, it is all about transforming people lives and makes their life a better one. Hence interior design is much important than it seem.. So its wise to hire an interior designer as they are qualified by edification, skill, practice, and examination to enrich utility and quality of interior space. There are worthy reasons to hire an interior designer not only while building a new house but also during a renovation as it ensures that it brings out the exact look and design we wish to have, that makes us a pride owner.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">How we design </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">One of the things that makes this field especially exciting is there are   so many ways you can use your design talent. For example, you canDecorate homes of varying architectural    styles to give them a fresh, new look.Design custom interiors for a homebuilder's model homes. Work with builders' clients who need assistance making color choices for their newly built home (and maybe also get their business when they need help decorating it.Provide commercial design services.Function as a product-driven designer by both marketing products and designing interiors (the most common way to start out).There is one more type of interior designer that should be mentioned. A design consultant simply gives design advice rather than doing the hands-on work or selling product. This type of work is usually the bailiwick of designers with a great deal of experience, a respected reputation and a degree in the field, all things that fledgling business owners generally don't have when they start out. So for the purpose of this book, we're going to assume you'll take the hands-on route and leave the consulting to the experienced pros.</p>
